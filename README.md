# MoinMoin Wiki Container, powered by pypy2

OCI compliant container image to run MoinMoin wiki, accessible via HTTPS, delivered by nginx and uwsgi.

Ready to use, based on openSUSE Leap and the alternative Python Runtime [PyPy](https://www.pypy.org).

# Why

MoinMoin requires Python 2, the successor [moin2](https://github.com/moinwiki/moin), with Python 3 support, is under development and not released yet. Interested to help and contribute? See: [help wanted](https://github.com/moinwiki/moin/labels/help%20wanted) / [good first issue](https://github.com/moinwiki/moin/labels/good%20first%20issue)

It might be that User still want to keep using the latest stable release and wait with the migration.

The official Python 2 Runtime is [End-of-Life](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/) but PyPy will support Python 2 ["forever"](https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/faq.html#how-long-will-pypy-support-python2) and provide updates in future.

**Update 2023-10-09**: There is an alpha release of moin2 available on https://test.pypi.org/project/moin/, installation instructions can be found at https://github.com/moinwiki/moin/issues/1197.

# Features

## Enhancements

- Automatic creation of `superuser`.
- Pre-Installation of `essential_pages` package in english
- Backup feature configured and enabled
- New page `Administration` added to centralize management
    - Create new user accounts
    - Install page packages
    - Create and download a backup
    - Support to set FQDN for nginx (server-name) and self-signed SSL Certificates (common-name)

## Variables

- Manage superuser
    - `MAUSR` = Username, default: MoinAdmin
    - `MAPWD` = Password, default: Random generated and visible via 'stdout' (docker / podman logs)
    - `MAEML` = Email address, default: admin@moinmoin-pypy2.localhost

- Manage nginx / ssl
    - `FQDN` = Servername inklusive Domain, default: moinmoint-pypy2.localhost

- Manage MoinMoin wiki
    - `MSITENAME` = Custom wiki site name, default: Untitled Wiki

# Usage

The following examples were tested with `podman` (4.7.0) in rootless mode on openSUSE Tumbleweed (20231005).

## Pull

The pre-build image is available on [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/wombelix/moinmoin-pypy2?tab=info), you can pull it by running:

```
podman pull quay.io/wombelix/moinmoin-pypy2
```

The container image with label `latest` is based to the last git tag and release. Branches like `main` will not automatically build and uploaded.

## Persistent Volume

All wiki data are located in `/usr/local/share/moin/`, just use the `-v` (--volume) argument to define the `name` as first value (in this example `wiki`), to ensure your data get stored properly and can easy identified later.

```
podman run -d -v wiki:/usr/local/share/moin --name wiki quay.io/wombelix/moinmoin-pypy2
```

You can use `podman volume ls` to show all existing volumes:

```
podman volume ls

DRIVER      VOLUME NAME
local       wiki
```

To get all details about a specific volume (in this example `wiki`) run `podman volume inspect wiki`:
```
[
    {
        "Name": "wiki",
        "Driver": "local",
        "Mountpoint": "/home/wombelix/.local/share/containers/storage/volumes/wiki/_data",
        "CreatedAt": "2021-10-09T12:29:07.76460396+02:00",
        "Labels": {},
        "Scope": "local",
        "Options": {}
    }
]

```

## Backup and Restore

There are a lot of good resources online, one approach can be found in the [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/#backup-restore-or-migrate-data-volumes).

It's up to you which way you choose, at the end it's more or less about a simple file backup. 

Just ensure that the folder mentioned as `Mountpoint` from the `podman volume inspect <volumename>` output (example out, see [Persistent Volume](#persistent-volume) above) is included.

## Expose Port

Inside the Container, nginx is listening on Port 443 for HTTPS requests. Use the `-p` (--publish) argument to define which Host Port should be mapped to the Container (in this example `8443`). This is the Port you going to use when accessing the wiki.

```
podman run -d -p 8443:443 -v wiki:/usr/local/share/moin/ --name wiki quay.io/wombelix/moinmoin-pypy2
```

## Environment Variables

`moinmoin-pypy2` support different environment variables to customize the configuration. To create the superuser `John Doe` with his EMail address `john.doe@example.org`:

```
podman run -d -p 8443:443 -v wiki:/usr/local/share/moin/ --name wiki -e MAUSR=JohnDoe -e MWEML=john.doe@example.org quay.io/wombelix/moinmoin-pypy2
```

You can check the status via `podman logs wiki`, the last argument (`wiki` in this example) depends on the name of your container.

```

## User and Password

If you started without existing wiki data, a new `superuser` will be created during the initial setup. You can define a password by setting the environment variable `MAPWD`, otherwise a random password will be generated for you. In this case, you can find it in the `podman logs` output, as in the above `Environment Variables` example.

## Custom SSL Certificates

By default, new self-signed SSL Certificates will be generated during container startup if `/etc/ssl/certs/cert.pem` and `/etc/ssl/private/key.pem` not exist.

You can use your own / already existing certificates as well. In this example the local files `~/wiki/cert.pem` and `~/wiki/key.pem` will be mounted read-only into the Container and used instead the default self-signed certificates.

```
podman run -d -p 8443:443 --name wiki -v ~/wiki/cert.pem:/etc/ssl/certs/cert.pem:ro -v ~/wiki/key.pem:/etc/ssl/private/key.pem:ro quay.io/wombelix/moinmoin-pypy2
```
